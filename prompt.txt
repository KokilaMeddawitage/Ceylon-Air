Build a cross-platform React Native (JavaScript) mobile app called CeylonAir that monitors Air Quality Index (AQI) and UV Index (UVI) for users in Sri Lanka.
The app must demonstrate mobile computing concepts — context-awareness, mobility, edge processing, and sensor integration — using the following specification.

Core Idea:
CeylonAir auto-detects the user’s location via GPS and periodically (hourly) retrieves AQI and UV data from public APIs — IQAir, OpenWeatherMap, and WeatherAPI.
It processes these readings locally using a hybrid algorithm to determine an Atmosphere Health Score, displays it on a color-coded dashboard, and triggers 
context-aware notifications when risk levels exceed WHO/EPA thresholds.

Functional Modules:

Location (GPS): Use react-native-geolocation-service or expo-location to fetch latitude/longitude.
API Layer (Axios):
IQAir → AQI (nearest station).
OpenWeatherMap → AQI + weather context.
WeatherAPI → UV Index.

Store API keys as placeholders.
Hybrid Edge Algorithm:
Prefer IQAir if station <2 km & <1 h old;
2–10 km → average IQAir + OpenWeather;
10 km or stale → use OpenWeather.

Weight example: 10 km = 0.7/0.3, 30 km = 0.5/0.5.

Risk Scoring:
AQI categories: 0-50 Good, 51-100 Moderate, 101-150 Unhealthy-SG, >150 Unhealthy+.
UV: 0-2 Low, 3-5 Moderate, 6-7 High, 8-10 Very High, 11+ Extreme.
Final risk = worst of AQI/UV or via matrix.

Scheduler + Alerts:
Background fetch hourly (react-native-background-fetch or Expo).
Trigger local notification (react-native-push-notification) when AQI > 150 or UV > 8.
Storage: Cache last readings & thresholds in AsyncStorage.

UI:
Dashboard with AQI, UV, Atmosphere Score cards (color-coded).
Map (react-native-maps) showing nearby stations.

Simple chart (react-native-chart-kit / victory-native).
Settings for custom alert thresholds.

Goal:
Generate a working scaffold with mock API placeholders,
hourly background logic, GPS sensing, hybrid AQI + UV computation, 
and local notifications — all in JavaScript (React Native).
